								<h2>Intent Recognition</h2>
								<p>The ML project on Intent recognition focuses on developing a machine learning model 
									that accurately identifies and classifies user intents in natural language processing (NLP) 
									tasks. By training the model on labeled data, it can accurately predict the intention behind 
									user queries or statements, enabling more effective chatbots, voice assistants, and customer 
									support systems. This project showcases the application of ML algorithms in understanding and 
									interpreting user intent, leading to improved user experiences and streamlined interactions.</p>

								<h2>Stroke Prediction</h2>
								<p>The Stroke Prediction Machine Learning project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately 
									identify individuals at high risk of experiencing a stroke. By leveraging machine learning algorithms 
									and a comprehensive dataset comprising various risk factors, medical history, lifestyle habits, and 
									demographic information, the project seeks to uncover patterns and indicators associated with stroke 
									occurrence. The model will be trained on historical data, continuously learning and refining its 
									predictions over time. By accurately predicting stroke risk, healthcare professionals can proactively 
									identify at-risk individuals and implement preventive measures such as lifestyle interventions, 
									medication management, and regular monitoring. This project ultimately aims to improve stroke 
									prevention efforts, enhance patient care, and reduce the incidence of stroke-related disabilities 
									and mortality.</p>

								<h2>Topic Modeling</h2>
								<p>The Topic Modeling ML project focuses on developing a model that can automatically analyze
									 and categorize large volumes of text data into meaningful topics. By utilizing machine learning 
									 algorithms, the project aims to uncover underlying themes, subjects, and patterns within the text. 
									 The model is trained on a diverse dataset containing textual documents such as articles, blog posts,
									  customer reviews, or social media posts. Through a process of unsupervised learning, the model 
									  identifies words, phrases, and co-occurring patterns to assign documents to relevant topics. This 
									  project is valuable for various applications, including information retrieval, content recommendation, 
									  sentiment analysis, market research, and trend analysis. By automatically organizing and understanding 
									  textual data, the topic modeling machine learning project enables efficient and effective analysis, 
									  decision-making, and knowledge extraction from large text collections.</p>
